In this thesis we introduce \cphash{} $-$ a scalable fixed size hash
table that supports eviction using an LRU list, and \cpserver{} $-$
a scalable in memory key/value cache server that uses \cphash{} to
implement its hash table. \cphash{} uses computation migration to avoid
transferring data between cores.  Experiments on a 48 core machine show
that \cphash{} has 2 to 3 times higher throughput than a hash table
implemented using scalable fine-grained locks. \cpserver{} achieves 1.2
to 1.7 times higher throughput than a key/value cache server that uses a
hash table with scalable fine-grained locks and 1.5 to 2.6 times higher
throughput than \memcached{}.
