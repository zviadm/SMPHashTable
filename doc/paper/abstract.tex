  \cphash{} is a scalable fixed-size hash table with LRU-eviction for multicore
  processors.  \cphash{} partitions its table across the caches of cores and
  uses message passing to transfer lookups/inserts to a partition.  Compared to
  a design with fine-grained locking, \cphash{} reduces coherence and capacity
  misses.  Experiments on a 48 core machine show that \cphash{} has 2 to 3 times
  higher throughput than a hash table implemented using scalable fine-grained
  locks. \cpserver{}, a key/value cache server, using \cphash{}, achieves 1.2 to
  1.7 times higher throughput than a key/value cache server that uses a hash
  table with scalable fine-grained locks and 1.5 to 2.6 times higher throughput
  than \memcached{}.
