In this thesis we introduce \cphash{} $-$ a scalable fixed size hash table that supports eviction
using an LRU list, and \cpserver{} $-$ a scalable in memory key/value cache server that uses \cphash{} 
to implement its hash table. \cphash{} uses computation migration to avoid transferring data between cores. 
Experiments on a 48 core machine show that \cphash{} has 2 to 3 times higher throughput than a hash
table implemented using scalable fine-grained locks. \cpserver{} achieves
1.2 to 1.7 times higher throughput than a key/value cache server that uses a hash table with
scalable fine-grained locks and 1.5 to 2.6 times higher throughput than \memcached{}.
