How to Build:

Code can be built by just typing make. Makefile is pretty simple and self explanatory.

To build hash server benchmarks you will need libmemcached
installed with static libraries enabled (run ./configure --enable-static). 
Also libmemcached has a retarded bug for multi get in binary protocol, 
so you will need to go in libmemcached/fetch.cc file and change strncpy to memcpy
to fix it (I have no idea why they don't fix that).

Executables:

testhashtable - Super simple tests for SMPHashTable, just run using ./testhashtable
benchhashtable - SMPHashTable benchmarks. It has quite a few parameters, run ./benchhashtable -h for usage.
hashserver2 - Memcached like Key/Value cache server. run ./hashserver2 -h for usage.
benchhashserver - Hash Server and Memcached benchamrks. run ./benchhashserver -h for usage.
